## 🚀 How to Run These Projects

All projects in this repo use **Vite**. To run a specific project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/react-course-projects.git](https://github.com/your-username/react-course-projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd counter  # (or any other folder name)
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🛠️ Concepts Learned
* **Virtual DOM**: How React handles rendering.
* **JSX**: Writing HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.
* **Hooks**: Managing state with `useState`.
* **Props**: Passing data between components.
* **Vite**: Setting up a modern, fast development environment.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling for React components.
